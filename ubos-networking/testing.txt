= Testing ubos-networking =

This requires installing openbsd-netcat.
The device under test is called subject
The device used for testing is called tester, tester1 or tester2

== Single-Ethernet physical device ==

=== Config: client (connected) ===

Connect subject to existing network
Connect tester to existing network

1. Do: boot subject
       login from console
       ubos-admin setnetconfig client
   Observe: ip addr -- subject has acquired DHCP address
2. Do@tester> curl http://subject/
   Observe: UBOS web page comes up
3. Do@tester> ssh subject
   Observe: login dialog comes up (we don't have credentials, so stop here)
4. Do@subject: curl ubos.net
   Observe: web page comes up
5. Do@subject> nc -l 2222
   Do@tester> telnet subject 2222
   Observe: cannot connect
6. Do@tester: avahi-browse -a
   Observe@tester: found ubos-pc.local
   Observe@tester: ubos-pc.local and subject have same IP address

=== Config: off ===

Connect subject to existing network
Connect tester to existing network

1. Do: boot subject
       login from console
       ubos-admin setnetconfig off
   Observe: ip addr -- no interface on subject has IP address
2. Do@tester> curl http://subject/
   Observe: cannot connect
3. Do@tester> ssh subject
   Observe: cannot connect
4. Do@subject: curl ubos.net

=== Config: standalone ===

Connect tester to subject. Do not connect either to anything else

1. Do: boot subject
       login from console
       ubos-admin setnetconfig standalone
   Observe@subject: ip addr -- subject has 10.0.0.0/16 address
   Observe@tester: ip addr -- tester has obtained DHCP IP address
2. Do@tester> curl http://subject/
   Observe: UBOS web page comes up
3. Do@tester> ssh subject
   Observe: login dialog comes up (we don't have credentials, so stop here)
4. Do@subject: curl ubos.net
   Observe: cannot eonnect
5. Do@subject> nc -l 2222

=== Config: gateway ===

Connect subject to existing network

1. Do: boot subject
       login from console
       ubos-admin setnetconfig gateway
   Observe@subject: error message

== Dual-Ethernet physical device ==

Perform same tests as for single-Ethernet device, on all interfaces,
except for "Config: gateway"

=== Config: gateway ===

Connect subject's eth0 to existing network
Connect subject's eth1 to tester1
Connect tester2 to existing network

1. Do: boot subject
       login from console
       ubos-admin setnetconfig gateway
   Observe@subject: ip addr eth0 -- subject obtained DHCP IP address
   Observe@subject: ip addr eth1 -- subject has 10.0.0.0/16 address
   Observe@tester1: ip addr -- tester has obtained DHCP IP address from subject, not network
2. Do@tester1> curl http://subject/
   Observe: UBOS web page comes up
3. Do@tester1> ssh subject
   Observe: login dialog comes up (we don't have credentials, so stop here)
4. Do@subject: curl ubos.net
   Observe: web page comes up
5. Do@tester1: curl ubos.net
   Observe: web page comes up
6. Do@subject> nc -l 2222
   Do@tester1> telnet subject 2222
   Observe: cannot connect
7. Do@tester2> curl http://subject/
   Observe: UBOS web page comes up
8. Do@tester2> ssh subject
   Observe: login dialog comes up (we don't have credentials, so stop here)
9. Do@subject> nc -l 2222
   Do@tester1> telnet subject 2222
   Observe: cannot connect
10.Do@subject> nc -l 2222
   Do@tester2> telnet subject 2222
   Observe: cannot connect
11.Do tester1: ping tester2
   Observe: ping successful
12.Do tester2: ping tester1
   Observe: ping unsuccessful

== Cloud server ==

1. Do: Boot subject
   Do@tester: ping subject
   Observe: subject has obtained DHCP IP address
2. Do@tester: curl http://subject/
   Observe: UBOS web page comes up
3. Do@tester: ssh shepherd@subject -- use cloud credentials specified when booting
   Observe: login successful
4. Do@subject: curl ubos.net
   Observe: web page comes up
5. Do@subject> nc -l 2222
   Do@tester> telnet subject 2222
   Observe: cannot connect


== Later --
=== Config: client (disconnected) ===
